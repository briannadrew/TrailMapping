# Kingston Trails

This site displays the trails located in the city of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Currently, it has the trails colour-coded based on their trail type, and you can click on the trails to get more information, such as activities and accessibility.

The mapping functionality is thanks to the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/">ArcGIS SDK for JavaScript</a>. The trail GeoJSON data was retrieved from <a href="https://opendatakingston.cityofkingston.ca/explore/dataset/trails/table/">Open Data Kingston</a>.

Note: This is an overhaul of my previous R project found [here](https://github.com/briannadrew/spatial-google-maps).

# Future Development

My plans to develop this further include, but are not limited to the following:

- Improved responsiveness
- Symbols in popups
- Filter options
- 3-D mapping
- More feature layers based on additional data from Open Data Kingston (e.g. rivers, roads, etc.)
- Try to make all segments of the same trails connect upon interaction (if possible)
